            <h4 class="header light blue-grey-text section-title">Students, why should you care about the new 7+H schedule?</h4>
            <div class="hr"></div>
            <p class="flow-text indent"><strong>It cuts a credit.</strong> That one elective you’ve been eyeing on the catalog since Freshman Year? That one AP course you’ve dying to take? That’s gone. Most people are required to take 6 credits worth of required “core subject” classes, leaving only two electives at most or just one additional course. Andover High Students are some of the most passionate students, and the our potential is being hampered.</p>
            <p class="flow-text indent"><strong>8-day rotation cycle.</strong> Umm… there’s 5 days in the school week. Switching to an 8-day rotation? We all know how terrible the hallways are, can you imagine how terrible and unbearable they’ll become? The blocks are arranged in such an inefficient style to complement this. I know it took me several weeks to memorize my schedule, how many weeks will it take for us to remember which class we go to next?</p>
            <p class="flow-text indent"><strong>Your bags just got a whole lot larger - or your binders a whole lot smaller.</strong> An advantage of the current block-schedule is that you have 4 classes during one semester, 5 at the most. However, with the new 7+H Schedule, you have all your 7 classes at one time! I know I struggle to fit 3 or 4 binders in my bag, so how am I supposed to fit 7 different ones?</p>
            <p class="flow-text indent"><strong>The dreaded word: homework.</strong> Oh yes, homework. That one word strikes fear into the hearts of many. With the new 7+H Schedule coming around, and seven classes coming around, enjoy having more than 50&#37; more homework! Andover students engage in many extracurriculars, sports, or work, and with the new schedule, your time engaging in these activities just got cut dramatically! In addition, having almost double the number of classes means more studying for tests, more last-minute all-nighters for presentations, and more cramming for an additional day of finals! Sure, there will only be 5 classes a day, but fitting in the homework of all those different classes, even over 2 days, will be a struggle!</p>
            <p class="flow-text indent"><strong>You never had a say in the matter.</strong> Remember that day where they came around and asked us about our feelings on the new schedule? No one does, because that day never happened. Even though an astounding 80% of students don’t like the new schedule (according to a survey done by the Statistics Class of 2016), the schedule committee never acknowledged any opinions by the students or teachers that conflicted with their agendas, but rather pushed ahead.</p>
