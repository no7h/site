Without the option to take 8 credits it makes it extremely hard to fit in the AP courses we want to take and limits the amount of interesting electives we can take. I have been looking forward to selecting cool electives since junior year offers more options but now that I have to fill my schedule with core classes and AP there is no room for those courses where as if the old schedule was still her I could take two electives of choice.

Additionally, it prevents students from doubling up on classes to get to the highest level of education possible in high school.
