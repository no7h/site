Students want a schedule that gives us room to take the classes we need and want in order to prepare us for our futures, and this new schedule isn't going to do that. Everyone probably agrees that our current schedule has some problems, and the administration should ask students what they are and come up with a better schedule together. I suggest that the district asks students to form a representative panel, around 20-25 students, who will represent us when negotiating new schedule. I am sure that students at all grade levels will be more than happy to create such a panel. At the end of the day, the district must remember that it's our futures that are on the line.

Removing the opportunity to take 8 credits in one year may seem like a way to remove stress from students lives, but it limits my personal opportunities for achievement. It is also not certain that all teachers will cut back on homework loads, with as many classes as we would have in one day the hours of homework would give us little to no sleep or time for sports and family commitments. This is a main concern of high school students. The new schedule is supposed to reduce stress, but instead it is already making students nervous for their futures. Another main concern is with the concept of H-block, as a student I believe that we as a school will not take the H-block seriously. Instead students will abuse the time given for the H-block and not get any work done within the very short amount of time given. Many students also rely on study halls to get work done, especially those who have sports and after school commitments.
