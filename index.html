            <h5>How many classes will I be able to take?</h5>
            <p>You will have seven opportunities for classes not 8. The H-block will give you an opportunity to personalize your day with teachers. By going to the new schedule, we are reducing the number of classes teachers teach over the school year.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hurt" class="container-fluid">
            <h5>Will the new schedule hurt me academically?</h5>
            <p>Having it year long instead of a semester is better for you guys, and it’s matched by the general trend in education right now. The reduction of a course is not because of anything other than that we are trying to get the teachers to go from 6 to 5. It also gives you choices. Most students take 7.5 credits and not 8, and the number of credits you take is not as important as what you actually do in you school year.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="homework" class="container-fluid">
            <h5>How will teachers change their homework assignments?</h5>
            <p>The amount of homework will be over an entire year, not a semester. The teachers are going to be under the same constraints, so they aren’t going to be giving what they are giving right now due to the extra amount of students. The teachers are going to have to balance what they can do because they are going to go from having 75 students in a semester to having 120. The other part is that they will get to know you, and they will be able to give better assignments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>Will I still have TA opportunities?</h5>
            <p>TA’s still exist. You will actually be able to study during the school day with your teacher for tests, if you so choose.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>Why do some classes take up 1.5 credits?</h5>
            <p>AP Chem and AP Bio need to be 1.5 credits because of the lab, which is typical for the year-long schedules. Instead of trying to cram it into 1 credits, we get to take more time. This schedule gives you the opportunity to have classes at different times in the day, if you are more alert or less alert at different times. It also stops penalizing first-block teachers for students who are consistently late.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>Will I still be able to double up?</h5>
            <p>You will still be able to double up if you need to, albeit at the cost of an elective like you do now. We will add the Virtual Consortium to help students who want to take their eighth class, but the eighth class is not what’s important. What is important is your ‘passion projects’ where you work on something that you discovered you liked in a class that there is not time to go over.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>Why were students not allowed to give input?</h5>
            <p>There was student input in the beginning, around 6 years ago. Part of the implementation of this is to move teachers from 6 to 5 classes. The number of classes you take is not going to detrimentally affect your college applications. A number of educators have worked on this schedule over many years to find the best parts of year-long schedules. Principals, teachers, administrators, and students helped in the beginning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>Why are the 2018 and 2019 classes suffering the most?</h5>
            <p>It had to have happened to somebody, and that happened to be the classes of 2018 and 2019. It will be harder for you to make the adjustment, but this would have had to have happened anyway.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>How long will my classes be?</h5>
            <p>The class lengths are 60 minutes, 75 minutes, and 80 minutes. You will only have 5 classes a day instead of 7, so you should have time to have a snack and do what it is that you set out to do in your H-Block. All classes meet 5 times, and they all have varied lengths.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>How does the H-Block work?</h5>
            <p>With H-block, you will sign up for H2-5 in H1. If you can’t get into your math teacher for H2, you can try for H3-5. The popular teachers will definitely fill up, so you may have to plan for that ahead of time. Teachers can also request students, so you can ask you teacher to request you if you need to study for a test. You also have the ability to go to a teacher from a previous year who you know to ask for help.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>How does the schedule benefit students with learning disabilities?</h5>
            <p>The students who need time in the resource rooms will continue to get time in the resource rooms. They will have their opportunity to be with a special education teacher during a block. One of the things we think might happen is that students will get the opportunity during H-block to get support from their teachers, so they won’t necessarily lose out on support. Having opportunities to meet with their teachers during the school day will lessen their anxiety. Having classes of 60, 75, and 80 minutes will be better for somebody with ADHD because they won’t be sitting in one class for 84 minutes at a time every time. ADHD medications have peaks and valleys at different times in the day, so you won’t be taking the same class during your low every day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>Why might the schedule be a good thing?</h5>
            <p>The new schedule has a number of things that it does better than the old schedule. The year long classes rather than semester long classes close the gaps in your learning. It gives you the opportunity to personalize your school day. It changes the number of periods you have each day and the number of minutes per period, which allows for better adjustment with snow days and absent days. It gives us opportunities to meet together in large groups. It gives guidance opportunities to meet without taking away from class time, and helps us with advisory learning.</p>
