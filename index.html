                <hr class="intro">
                <p class="center-align">The <strong class="blue-grey-text">7+H schedule</strong> is a proposed change to the Current Block Schedule. The New Schedule proposes that the 4-block 2-semester be switched to a <strong>8-day rotation</strong> with <strong>5 classes a day</strong>. However, the <strong>current 8 credits will be replaced with 7</strong>, and there will be a <strong>new block, dubbed the H-Block</strong>, replacing the lost credit.</p>
                <p class="center-align">The new schedule has been in development for over <strong>5 years</strong>, as a result of the teacher-district contract negotiations. An independent mediator was brought in by the state of Massachusetts due to the teachers disagreeing with their new contract, which required them to teach an extra class without an increase in pay. This mediator sided with the district, making the teachers teach an extra class, but as a stipulation, teachers and the district were required to form a new schedule; together. The 7+H schedule is a direct result of these negotiations.</p>
                <p class="center-align">The 7+H schedule has been <strong class="red-text text-lighten-1">badly received</strong> by both students and teachers alike. Our current statistics (as of 3/26/17) find <strong class="red-text text-lighten-1">86% of students</strong> in dissent of it, with 7% indifferent. <strong class="red-text text-lighten-1">61% of teachers oppose the new schedule</strong>. The new changes are not favorable; losing a credit is hard for many, the 8-day rotation is bound to give headaches, and having 7 classes at once? It sounds like a recipe for true disaster, and many students agree.</p>
                <p class="center-align">However, whatâ€™s most disheartening with the new schedule is the <strong>lack of input from Students</strong>. Were the students ever consulted on this issue? It was simply presented to them one day, and they were forced to accept it. <strong>Schools are meant for the student</strong>, and this pushes against the qualities that make Andover students great; the passion, the drive, and the shared sense of community. The new schedule disrupts all of these conditions.</p>
                <p class="center-align">Ever since the schedule was introduced, there have been many attempts to get it shut down. However, all attempts have unfortunately failed. This time around, we want to stop the schedule, and <strong>we are willing to put in the time and effort required</strong>. We are a team of <strong>5 dedicated sophomores</strong>, who care about our fellow peers and want the best for them.</p>

                                <p class="indent">I think that this benefits the average student more than it may benefit a student considered 'above average'. From what I know, the H block is meant for students to go talk to their teachers about their classes and ask for help if they really need it. For a student who doesn't need this enrichment, the H block is completely useless unless they're able to do homework. Also after reading the information on the no7H website, this schedule change should cost a million dollars. That 1 million dollars can be used for something a lot more useful than a schedule change. They can raise the teacher's salaries, or use it to create more classes. Personally, I don't think this would benefit me and I'd rather be able to take another class instead of wasting an hour doing nothing.</p>

I believe that it takes away from the students' education, creativity and well being at the school. It could potentially be overwhelming with there being so many different days, planning home life with school life, and not being able to have more experience with different classes. I believe that I have a well enough understanding of both schedules by hearing from different high schoolers and being explained the new schedule. After being exposed to both of them I would like to keep the old schedule. </p>

I only get to pick two electives instead of being able to take the three that I want, and the H block is useless for people who do not need extra help in any way. This new schedule is a waste of time and money to put together and they should just stick to blue and gold days.</p>

It will make it much harder to find all of the rooms and memorize the schedule, as opposed to the current one where students more or less have the same classes everyday. I found it tricky enough to find and memorize the order of my classes and to find the quickest routes to get from one to the next with their only being four a day, and I am certain that the new schedule will make it that much harder for incoming Freshman to navigate AHS.</p>

With the schedule we have now we have more time to focus on the four classes we have each semester. We have more time to study for finals and or midterms. On the other hand. With the new schedule we are going to have to focus on 7 classes, sports, etc. lots of us get home at five or even eight o'clock at night and only have a few hours to do our homework. And we already have lots now! We need sleep and we need time for ourselves as well. I think the schedule we have now works just fine.</p>

                                <p>To Whom it may Concern:</p>
                                <p class="indent">Given the vast popularity of this topic, I will not waste your time with extraneous paragraphs with excessive explanations of numerous reasons that the 7+H block schedule is malicious to our school system. Rather, I will be focusing this letter on the an effect of the implementation of the new schedule that is overlooked by students. Quite simply: we, as a town, cannot afford this schedule. To support the required staff, textbooks, and other materials to allow for year-long courses that run concurrently, the schools would need to appropriate additional funds, somewhere in the range of one million dollars. One million dollars that, in all likelihood, will not be added to the schoolâ€™s annual budget.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Where then will the money to support this schedule come from? The arts. We have seen this time and time again whenever money is needed elsewhere in the schools. Courses in the visual and performing arts get reduced or removed completely. Full credit courses become half credit become nonexistent. Funds to support the programs and materials are taken from an already financially struggling department to support a schedule that the student body of Andover High School has such strong feelings against.</p>
                                <p class="indent">The implementation of this schedule requires students to take a free block, as opposed to the optional study students may opt in or opt out of with the current 2 day block rotation schedule. While this gives students time to work with their teachers, it deprives them of the ability to take an additional half credit course. As most of the courses in the arts are half credit courses, not only will this schedule be depriving the arts the money to support their curriculums, but fewer students will have the option to take the courses offered. With the current schedule, students still have time to work with their instructors in a study, if they choose to take one. It does not, however, require students to take a break period. Students may fill their schedule completely with courses if they prefer the additional credit.</p>
                                <p class="indent">If Andover schools truly did honor the voices of their students, this schedule would not be implemented. The overwhelming protest of the schedule by students, teachers, and parents alike are ignored by the administration that continues on with the H block schedule. If we still believe in an earnest democracy, we will not just request from the school board, but demand from our elected officials to protect the beliefs of our students, and overrule the choice of the High School administration for the use of the 7+H block schedule.</p>

                                <p class="indent">As Andover High School approaches a new year of exciting learning and discovering new interests and ideas, a controversy arises. This is not one of great consequence, one that may determine the success of the students beyond high school. The 7+H schedule will be detrimental not only to a studentâ€™s learning, but also their personal stress levels. Proponents of the new schedule are willing to risk the mental health of an indeterminate number of students for MCAS test scores and for the sake of rotating classes throughout the day. Now, last time I checked, curbing the mental health and learning of our students to succeed on a state test was quite the opposite of an incomparable idea. After such great lengths of telling students that success matters more than a silly test, whatâ€™s changed? </p>
                                <p class="indent">Iâ€™m not convinced that the committee has even considered the financial repercussions that will inevitably take place. Advocates of the schedule offer one figure. $800,000. Now look, I completely understand that the expanded budget will take into account new hires to attend to the students who will be crammed like sardines into already bulging classrooms but what sense does that make? Weâ€™ve got schools like High Plain and many of the middle schools bursting at the seams taking on more and more students. Wouldnâ€™t that money be better off going towards repairing and constructing new buildings? The town of Andover needs to be more fiscally conservative and work on behalf of all of the students, not none of them. I recommend you vote your conscience this election and to take into account this disaster that will soon strike the school system.</p>

We can't double up on classes (example, you can't have two foreign language classes in a year as you can with the semesterized schedule) we don't have many options for our classes (7 credits instead of 8) , we'll look worse to high ranking private colleges because we haven't taken as many classes as other schools, the 8 day rotating thing is ridiculous as is H block, all of the finals will be at once, the blocks are much shorter and our tests might not be scaled down proportionately, and the teachers will not be used to giving out a proper amount of homework so they will give out far too much. Please repeal it or make a drastic change to it, my number one priority being bring back 8 credits or at least 7.5.</p>

                                <p class="indent">I don't think that this new schedule will benifit  the students education  since we will be losing the option to select classes for a whole credit. Many of us who are going to be juniors in the fall are looking to take AP classes to help get into a better college and to be able to take courses we are interested in. Without the option to take 8 credits it makes it extremely hard to fit in the AP courses we want to take and limits the amount of interesting electives we can take. I have been looking forward to selecting cool electives since junior year offers more options but now that I have to fill my schedule with core classes and AP there is no room for those courses where as if the old schedule was still her I could take two electives of choice. I think that this schedule does not take into account the students profile and interests and places more limitations than opportunities.</p>

It takes away one credit for us, which could be used for another AP or two electives. The general student body was not asked at all on their opinion of the new schedule. The town can have various committees and boards, but they all forget that the students are the ones attending the school and going through the scheduleâ€‹, not them. I believe that we should be drastically more involved in the schedule process.</p>

                                <p class="indent">The 7+H Schedule has been shoved onto us. During the 'discussion' process of the schedule, the almost unanimous view of the student body was that the schedule was a bad idea. When discussing this new schedule, the district held sham meetings and claimed that they would take student concerns into account, but if they actually did, the whole idea would've been scrapped. The goal of the district from the very beginning was to instate this schedule, and they weren't going to take no for an answer. Students want a schedule that gives us room to take the classes we need and want in order to prepare us for our futures, and this new schedule isn't going to do that. Everyone probably agrees that our current schedule has some problems, and the administration should ask students what they are and come up with a better schedule together. I suggest that the district asks students to form a representative panel, around 20-25 students, who will represent us when negotiating new schedule. I am sure that students at all grade levels will be more than happy to create such a panel. At the end of the day, the district must remember that it's our futures that are on the line. We shouldn't be disadvantaged when applying for college because of this bureaucratic nonsense. We deserve better.</p>

                                <p class="indent">Not a good idea. It will cause a huge amount of confusion with it being an 8 day rotation (lots of people can't even remember if it's a blue or gold day). On top of that it will cost our town's taxpayers more money due to the need to hire more teachers. Also with the new schedule we are unable to sign up for the same number of credits as before. Only allowing us to take 7 credits instead of 8, making it much harder to take the electives and other classes that we want to make the most of our high school experience and get the right credits for the college we want to attend. Now i'm sure many of us like only having a certain class for half the year, it gives us a break from harder classes and with only having at most 4 academics it allows us to focus more on each class. Overall the 7+H schedule will not be benificial to our education or social atmosphere here at Andover High School.</p>

                                <p class="indent">The new schedule Andover plans to put into effect will be more detrimental to students lives than it will be helpful. This schedule doesn't allow me room to take the courses I was looking forward to taking before I graduated. If I had joan that this schedule would be put into place sooner, even before I entered high school, I might have had time to figure out which classes I would have wanted to take. Instead, I do not have the opportunities to take classes that would be helpful to my college career, like AP courses that require 1.5 credits. Removing the opportunity to take 8 credits in one year may seem like a way to remove stress from students lives, but it limits my personal opportunities for achievement. It is also not certain that all teachers will cut back on homework loads, with as many classes as we would have in one day the hours of homework would give us little to no sleep or time for sports and family commitments. This is a main concern of high school students. The new schedule is supposed to reduce stress, but instead it is already making students nervous for their futures. Another main concern is with the concept of H-block, as a student I believe that we as a school will not take the H-block seriously. Instead students will abuse the time given for the H-block and not get any work done within the very short amount of time given. Many students also rely on study halls to get work done, especially those who have sports and after school commitments. Overall the 7H schedule has already made students, teachers, and parents frustrated and nervous. This kind of change will only generate angry students. Andover High School doesn't have the support for a new schedule that it needs.</p>

I would much rather have the normal schedule because it would lessen my work load and the amount of content i receive in one school day.</p>

                                <p class="indent">The 7+H Schedule should not be put into use at Andover High School. The fact that it keeps us from taking more classes is ridiculous. It has forced many students to choose between academic classes and electives. Not being able to take interesting electives will make us appear one-sides and thus less desirable to colleges. On the flip side, not taking the extra academic could mean that we are missing out on high level classes that colleges like to see completed in high school.</p>

                                <p class="indent">With this new schedule I won't be able to take as many classes as I would like. This is a problem because some students, such as I are a part of the EGE program which requires us to take some required classes to complete the program and get the title of a "Global Scholar". So basically it's nearly impossible for us students to take the classes required by the high school, the EGE program, and the classes that we ourselves want to take. Also with this new 7+H Schedule we will have all of our final at the same time. Which most of us are not used to. This will make students stress out more than they already are when finals come around. </p>

                                <p class="indent">I believe the 7+H schedule is not going to be effective or useful to the majority of students at Andover High. Having one less credit makes it much more challenging for upperclassmen to fit in classes that they want to take along with the required courses. The H block is also likely to be a waste of space for many students. Classrooms will fill up fast and students will often not end up where they want to be, resulting in nothing more than a study. It may help the struggling students, but the 7+H schedule will decrease the experience of students who want to excel.</p>

                                <p class="indent">I like the idea of full year courses and getting to know teachers better however there are many thinggs wrong with the new schedule. It will be very overwhelming for many students because of the varying time of days the blocks are. The amount of homework for 7 classes will be way too big a change for all the current freshman, sophomores, and juniors. Also, I think H block is unneeded as it's pretty much an automatic study, which I do not want as a junior. I'd rather have the 1 credit to take another class or two. </p>

                                <p class="indent">As a student with ADHD and have been on an IEP for my middle school and high school career, I am beyond concerned with what the school will do about my assisted study as that will be gone with the 7+H block schedule. I have struggled with my learning disability for years, and I am so worried with not only the H block, however that is only the beginning of my concerns. The homework load, possibility of 7 tests in one day, extracirriculars, and of course finals. Not to mention, with this new schedule combined with my IEP, I cannot take ANY electives which mean a lot to me and to be honest, was the reason for any excitement for my junior year.  If this new schedule does happen, my life along will many others will be filled with twice the amount of anxiety that would have already occurred my junior year because of colleges.</p>

If administration/faculty was REALLY serious about this, they would ask the students how they could help us cope/transition to the 7 + H schedule. If this actually happens, teachers will be throwing the same amount of hw for four classes to seven classes. This is like telling us to learn piano in 2 days.</p>

                                <p class="indent">The 7+H schedule will cause more stress for students than before. We now have to keep up with 7 credits worth of classes at once instead of 3.5 or 4 at once. We also have to do 7 classes worth of homework. Especially for those taking and AP or multiple, that leaves no time for activities or relaxation time. I know lots of us already have so much anxiety from school and feel that the new schedule will just push us over the edge and like we will have a mental breakdown every week. I think the majority of the student body and staff are against the new schedule and that the administration is just not listening to us. </p>

Having 7 classes means seven hw assignments a night, seven projects to do, and seven tests to study for all at the same time, because we all know teachers don't coordinate these things and don't care if you have other classes to deal with. It's so unreasonable and unnecessary I'm getting anxious just writing about it.</p>

As a student who is interested in the sciences, the inability to take two science AP's in one year is truly unfair, if a student is willing to challenge themselves, why take that opportunity away from them? The overall cost, confusion with the blocks and how the schedule will run, and the H block situation that I find wholly unnecessary all jumble up into one big confusing concoction of worry. I truly don't wish to see the new schedule taking place next year, for it will make my life and the lives of a plethora of my peers much more complicated and stressful.</p>

                                <p class="indent">I believe the 7+H schedule limits a student's ability to take classes of choice. As a sophomore, I will have 6 required credits next year. I want to take statistics, but this gives me no flexibility to take AP Biology or AP Chemistry due to them being 1.5 credits or any electives worth 0.5 credits. With the current schedule, there is an opportunity to explore new electives and new schedule strongly limits this.</p>

                                <p class="indent">In my opinion, the 7+H schedule is not viable. The school lacks the budget and the students lack the preparation to go into the next year with this schedule. It will revert students to a middle school-style schedule rather than one that they will experience in college, a semester system with four classes per semester much like our current one. Additionally, it prevents students from doubling up on classes to get to the highest level of education possible in high school. This will leave students with a lesser degree of knowledge and make them less competitive to colleges. Overall, the 7+H schedule would be a huge step backwards in the attempt to advance Andover High School.</p>
