                                <p class="indent">I think that this benefits the average student more than it may benefit a student considered 'above average'. From what I know, the H block is meant for students to go talk to their teachers about their classes and ask for help if they really need it. For a student who doesn't need this enrichment, the H block is completely useless unless they're able to do homework. Also after reading the information on the no7H website, this schedule change should cost a million dollars. That 1 million dollars can be used for something a lot more useful than a schedule change. They can raise the teacher's salaries, or use it to create more classes. Personally, I don't think this would benefit me and I'd rather be able to take another class instead of wasting an hour doing nothing.</p>

It will make it much harder to find all of the rooms and memorize the schedule, as opposed to the current one where students more or less have the same classes everyday. I found it tricky enough to find and memorize the order of my classes and to find the quickest routes to get from one to the next with their only being four a day, and I am certain that the new schedule will make it that much harder for incoming Freshman to navigate AHS.</p>

                                <p>To Whom it may Concern:</p>
                                <p class="indent">Given the vast popularity of this topic, I will not waste your time with extraneous paragraphs with excessive explanations of numerous reasons that the 7+H block schedule is malicious to our school system. Rather, I will be focusing this letter on the an effect of the implementation of the new schedule that is overlooked by students. Quite simply: we, as a town, cannot afford this schedule. To support the required staff, textbooks, and other materials to allow for year-long courses that run concurrently, the schools would need to appropriate additional funds, somewhere in the range of one million dollars. One million dollars that, in all likelihood, will not be added to the school’s annual budget.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Where then will the money to support this schedule come from? The arts. We have seen this time and time again whenever money is needed elsewhere in the schools. Courses in the visual and performing arts get reduced or removed completely. Full credit courses become half credit become nonexistent. Funds to support the programs and materials are taken from an already financially struggling department to support a schedule that the student body of Andover High School has such strong feelings against.</p>
                                <p class="indent">The implementation of this schedule requires students to take a free block, as opposed to the optional study students may opt in or opt out of with the current 2 day block rotation schedule. While this gives students time to work with their teachers, it deprives them of the ability to take an additional half credit course. As most of the courses in the arts are half credit courses, not only will this schedule be depriving the arts the money to support their curriculums, but fewer students will have the option to take the courses offered. With the current schedule, students still have time to work with their instructors in a study, if they choose to take one. It does not, however, require students to take a break period. Students may fill their schedule completely with courses if they prefer the additional credit.</p>
                                <p class="indent">If Andover schools truly did honor the voices of their students, this schedule would not be implemented. The overwhelming protest of the schedule by students, teachers, and parents alike are ignored by the administration that continues on with the H block schedule. If we still believe in an earnest democracy, we will not just request from the school board, but demand from our elected officials to protect the beliefs of our students, and overrule the choice of the High School administration for the use of the 7+H block schedule.</p>

                                <p class="indent">As Andover High School approaches a new year of exciting learning and discovering new interests and ideas, a controversy arises. This is not one of great consequence, one that may determine the success of the students beyond high school. The 7+H schedule will be detrimental not only to a student’s learning, but also their personal stress levels. Proponents of the new schedule are willing to risk the mental health of an indeterminate number of students for MCAS test scores and for the sake of rotating classes throughout the day. Now, last time I checked, curbing the mental health and learning of our students to succeed on a state test was quite the opposite of an incomparable idea. After such great lengths of telling students that success matters more than a silly test, what’s changed? </p>
                                <p class="indent">I’m not convinced that the committee has even considered the financial repercussions that will inevitably take place. Advocates of the schedule offer one figure. $800,000. Now look, I completely understand that the expanded budget will take into account new hires to attend to the students who will be crammed like sardines into already bulging classrooms but what sense does that make? We’ve got schools like High Plain and many of the middle schools bursting at the seams taking on more and more students. Wouldn’t that money be better off going towards repairing and constructing new buildings? The town of Andover needs to be more fiscally conservative and work on behalf of all of the students, not none of them. I recommend you vote your conscience this election and to take into account this disaster that will soon strike the school system.</p>

As a rising junior, there are many classes than I want to take, but the new scedule doesn't allow me to do so. People are arguing that it's better to have a full year rotation and people are resistant to change, when in reality students like me just want to take more courses.</p>

We can't double up on classes (example, you can't have two foreign language classes in a year as you can with the semesterized schedule) we don't have many options for our classes (7 credits instead of 8) , we'll look worse to high ranking private colleges because we haven't taken as many classes as other schools, the 8 day rotating thing is ridiculous as is H block, all of the finals will be at once, the blocks are much shorter and our tests might not be scaled down proportionately, and the teachers will not be used to giving out a proper amount of homework so they will give out far too much. Please repeal it or make a drastic change to it, my number one priority being bring back 8 credits or at least 7.5.</p>

                                <p class="indent">I don't think that this new schedule will benifit  the students education  since we will be losing the option to select classes for a whole credit. Many of us who are going to be juniors in the fall are looking to take AP classes to help get into a better college and to be able to take courses we are interested in. Without the option to take 8 credits it makes it extremely hard to fit in the AP courses we want to take and limits the amount of interesting electives we can take. I have been looking forward to selecting cool electives since junior year offers more options but now that I have to fill my schedule with core classes and AP there is no room for those courses where as if the old schedule was still her I could take two electives of choice. I think that this schedule does not take into account the students profile and interests and places more limitations than opportunities.</p>

There is no way for me to take as many APs or as many extracurricular classes as I would like to because of how restricting it is. </p>

I'm also concerned that I will not do well on tests because I won't have enough time to study due to the reason above. I also don't like how we aren't allowed to TA next year.</p>

                                <p class="indent">In my opinion, the 7+H schedule is not viable. The school lacks the budget and the students lack the preparation to go into the next year with this schedule. It will revert students to a middle school-style schedule rather than one that they will experience in college, a semester system with four classes per semester much like our current one. Additionally, it prevents students from doubling up on classes to get to the highest level of education possible in high school. This will leave students with a lesser degree of knowledge and make them less competitive to colleges. Overall, the 7+H schedule would be a huge step backwards in the attempt to advance Andover High School.</p>
