                    <hr class="intro">
                    <p class="center-align">The <strong class="blue-grey-text">7+H schedule</strong> is a proposed change to the Current Block Schedule. The New Schedule proposes that the 4-block 2-semester be switched to a <strong>8-day rotation</strong> with <strong>5 classes a day</strong>. However, the <strong>current 8 credits will be replaced with 7</strong>, and there will be a <strong>new block, dubbed the H-Block</strong>, replacing the lost credit.</p>
                    <p class="center-align">The new schedule has been in development for over <strong>5 years</strong>, as a result of the teacher-district contract negotiations. An independent mediator was brought in by the state of Massachusetts due to the teachers disagreeing with their new contract, which required them to teach an extra class without an increase in pay. This mediator sided with the district, making the teachers teach an extra class, but as a stipulation, teachers and the district were required to form a new schedule; together. The 7+H schedule is a direct result of these negotiations.</p>
                    
                    <p class="center-align">The 7+H schedule has been <strong>badly received</strong> by both students and teachers alike. Our current statistics (as of 3/26/17) find <strong>86% of students</strong> in dissent of it, with 7% indifferent. <strong>61% of teachers oppose the new schedule</strong>. The new changes are not favorable; losing a credit is hard for many, the 8-day rotation is bound to give headaches, and having 7 classes at once? It sounds like a recipe for true disaster, and many students agree.</p>
                    
                    <p class="center-align">However, whatâ€™s most disheartening with the new schedule is the <strong>lack of input from Students</strong>. Were the students ever consulted on this issue? It was simply presented to them one day, and they were forced to accept it. <strong>Schools are meant for the student</strong>, and this pushes against the qualities that make Andover students great; the passion, the drive, and the shared sense of community. The new schedule disrupts all of these conditions.</p>
                    
                    <p class="center-align">Ever since the schedule was introduced, there have been many attempts to get it shut down. However, all attempts have unfortunately failed. This time around, we want to stop the schedule, and <strong>we are willing to put in the time and effort required</strong>. We are a team of <strong>5 dedicated sophomores</strong>, who care about our fellow peers and want the best for them.</p>
