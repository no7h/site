                                <p>To Whom it may Concern:</p>
                                <p class="indent">Given the vast popularity of this topic, I will not waste your time with extraneous paragraphs with excessive explanations of numerous reasons that the 7+H block schedule is malicious to our school system. Rather, I will be focusing this letter on the an effect of the implementation of the new schedule that is overlooked by students. Quite simply: we, as a town, cannot afford this schedule. To support the required staff, textbooks, and other materials to allow for year-long courses that run concurrently, the schools would need to appropriate additional funds, somewhere in the range of one million dollars. One million dollars that, in all likelihood, will not be added to the school’s annual budget.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Where then will the money to support this schedule come from? The arts. We have seen this time and time again whenever money is needed elsewhere in the schools. Courses in the visual and performing arts get reduced or removed completely. Full credit courses become half credit become nonexistent. Funds to support the programs and materials are taken from an already financially struggling department to support a schedule that the student body of Andover High School has such strong feelings against.</p>
                                <p class="indent">The implementation of this schedule requires students to take a free block, as opposed to the optional study students may opt in or opt out of with the current 2 day block rotation schedule. While this gives students time to work with their teachers, it deprives them of the ability to take an additional half credit course. As most of the courses in the arts are half credit courses, not only will this schedule be depriving the arts the money to support their curriculums, but fewer students will have the option to take the courses offered. With the current schedule, students still have time to work with their instructors in a study, if they choose to take one. It does not, however, require students to take a break period. Students may fill their schedule completely with courses if they prefer the additional credit.</p>
                                <p class="indent">If Andover schools truly did honor the voices of their students, this schedule would not be implemented. The overwhelming protest of the schedule by students, teachers, and parents alike are ignored by the administration that continues on with the H block schedule. If we still believe in an earnest democracy, we will not just request from the school board, but demand from our elected officials to protect the beliefs of our students, and overrule the choice of the High School administration for the use of the 7+H block schedule.</p>

                                <p class="indent">As Andover High School approaches a new year of exciting learning and discovering new interests and ideas, a controversy arises. This is not one of great consequence, one that may determine the success of the students beyond high school. The 7+H schedule will be detrimental not only to a student’s learning, but also their personal stress levels. Proponents of the new schedule are willing to risk the mental health of an indeterminate number of students for MCAS test scores and for the sake of rotating classes throughout the day. Now, last time I checked, curbing the mental health and learning of our students to succeed on a state test was quite the opposite of an incomparable idea. After such great lengths of telling students that success matters more than a silly test, what’s changed? </p>
                                <p class="indent">I’m not convinced that the committee has even considered the financial repercussions that will inevitably take place. Advocates of the schedule offer one figure. $800,000. Now look, I completely understand that the expanded budget will take into account new hires to attend to the students who will be crammed like sardines into already bulging classrooms but what sense does that make? We’ve got schools like High Plain and many of the middle schools bursting at the seams taking on more and more students. Wouldn’t that money be better off going towards repairing and constructing new buildings? The town of Andover needs to be more fiscally conservative and work on behalf of all of the students, not none of them. I recommend you vote your conscience this election and to take into account this disaster that will soon strike the school system.</p>
