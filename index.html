                                <p>To Whom it may Concern:</p>
                                <p class="indent">Given the vast popularity of this topic, I will not waste your time with extraneous paragraphs with excessive explanations of numerous reasons that the 7+H block schedule is malicious to our school system. Rather, I will be focusing this letter on the an effect of the implementation of the new schedule that is overlooked by students. Quite simply: we, as a town, cannot afford this schedule. To support the required staff, textbooks, and other materials to allow for year-long courses that run concurrently, the schools would need to appropriate additional funds, somewhere in the range of one million dollars. One million dollars that, in all likelihood, will not be added to the schoolâ€™s annual budget.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Where then will the money to support this schedule come from? The arts. We have seen this time and time again whenever money is needed elsewhere in the schools. Courses in the visual and performing arts get reduced or removed completely. Full credit courses become half credit become nonexistent. Funds to support the programs and materials are taken from an already financially struggling department to support a schedule that the student body of Andover High School has such strong feelings against.</p>
                                <p class="indent">The implementation of this schedule requires students to take a free block, as opposed to the optional study students may opt in or opt out of with the current 2 day block rotation schedule. While this gives students time to work with their teachers, it deprives them of the ability to take an additional half credit course. As most of the courses in the arts are half credit courses, not only will this schedule be depriving the arts the money to support their curriculums, but fewer students will have the option to take the courses offered. With the current schedule, students still have time to work with their instructors in a study, if they choose to take one. It does not, however, require students to take a break period. Students may fill their schedule completely with courses if they prefer the additional credit.</p>
                                <p class="indent">If Andover schools truly did honor the voices of their students, this schedule would not be implemented. The overwhelming protest of the schedule by students, teachers, and parents alike are ignored by the administration that continues on with the H block schedule. If we still believe in an earnest democracy, we will not just request from the school board, but demand from our elected officials to protect the beliefs of our students, and overrule the choice of the High School administration for the use of the 7+H block schedule.</p>
