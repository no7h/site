            <p class="flow-text indent"><strong>It cuts a credit.</strong> Your children are ambitious, and will grow up to do great things. However, by reducing the credits by 8.0 to 7.0, your child loses the potential to take that one class that’s always eluding them. Most students at Andover High have a certain set of graduation requirements, each which cost 6 credits a year.</p>
            <p class="flow-text indent"><strong>You're paying for it.</strong> Your child attends a public school. Public schools are funded via tax dollars. If you or your child isn’t happy with the new schedule, you should get more involved. After all, you’re paying for it one way or the other, so you may as well ensure that your child likes everything about the school.</p>
            <p class="flow-text indent"><strong>Your kid probably doesn't want it.</strong> According to a survey done by the Statistics class of 2016, about 80% of students don’t want the new schedule. That’s an overwhelming supermajority! Just ask your children about it, and they’ll most likely tell you about Andover High’s reactions to it: students making sarcastic quips about it, teachers straying away from the topic to prevent arguments, and the administration repeatedly talking about how great the new schedule will be.</p>
            <p class="flow-text indent"><strong>What's the point?</strong> This debate over the new schedule has been going on for the past 5 or 6 years. If they haven’t implemented it yet due to budget constraints, general disapproval, then why should they implement it now, especially when the disapproval rating is at an all-time high?</p>
